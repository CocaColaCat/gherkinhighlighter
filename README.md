If you try to install Gherkin Syntax for SyntaxHighlighter Evolved as a plugin, you may come across
an error says: can not load Brush: Gherkin. 

I combined [Michael Hall](https://github.com/bankofcanada/gherkin-syntax-for-syntaxhighlighter-evolved)'s version
with the solution from [this post](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-gherkin-syntax-for-syntaxhighlighter-evolved-shbrushgherkinjs-is-empty).
And I changed the plugins_url in gherkin.php. It works. 

How to use:
1. download the zip
2. wd-admin -> Plugins -> Add New -> Upload -> Activate
